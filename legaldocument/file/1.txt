Now the Spring Festival has passed and the new semester is coming soon. 
Looking back on the past year, I have finished my small plans, but haven’t made 
any breakthrough. So I make up my mind that I must finish the tasks for the new 
semester. The first plan is to take regular exercise. I like to play computer games 
and sometimes I can't help staying up late, which makes me feel sleepy next day 
in class, so I need to sleep early and then do some sports to improve my efficiency. 
The second plan is to focus more attention to learn English. English is the 
international language, so I must learn it well, not only to make the way 
for study abroad someday, but also for travelling abroad. I need to have the 
strong will to fulfill my goals. 
I have a sister. She is younger than me. My sister has a special talent. She sings 
very well. Every time when she starts to sing, people will be quiet and listen to her 
singing. Sometimes I feel jealous, but I have to admit that her voice is so nice. I 
am so proud of being her sister, because we share the same families.
